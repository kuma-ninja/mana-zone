# Mana Zone
Project intended to expose easy filtering and searching capability over **Magic the Gathering** card catalog.  
And to avoid being yet another MTG card website, we intend to be yet another MTG card website **with steroids**.  
This project intends to make possible to facilitate your journey from card searching to deck composition and even 
looking for the vendor that best suits your budget and making possible doing a wishlist to shop cart integration to 
avoid the harassment of nitpicking each card until shopping checkout.
